  file.

  file.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-10-06

### Added

* repl: Add `--nickname/-N` to send REPL messages (out/err) to named user instead
  of all connected users.
* repl: Add `--notify-to-all` to force send messages to all users (old behaviour).
* repl: Add extra option `ghci` for `tidal` REPL type, for customizing ghci
  binary path.
* web: Show current Flok version when joining session.
* web: Include -N option on flok-repl example when joining session.

### Changed

* Now, by default, `flok-repl` *will not* send messages to all users by default.
  You need to enable the `--notify-to-all` option if you want the old
  behaviour. If `--nickname/-N` and `--notify-to-all` are not present,
  flok-repl won't send any messages, only print them on standard output/error.

### Added

* repl: Add new `--config` option for customizing parameters from a JSON file
* repl: Load config file from `FLOK_CONFIG` environment file, if defined. Also,
  load *.env files* automatically.

### Changed

  afterwards.
